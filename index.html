		<h2>Why PotatoOS?</h2>
		<p>PotatoOS is a "parasite" operating system designed to work on a host OS like Windows or Linux instead of bare-metal.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="card">
		<h4>Runs in your desktop</h4>
		<p>There's no need to install any complex bootloader or deal with partitions, PotatoOS runs directly on your existing OS.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="card">
		<h4>STARCH scripting language</h4>
		<p>PotatoOS's applications are built using the interpreted language STARCH, which has a simple syntax with easy system APIs.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="card">
		<h4>Cross-platform</h4>
		<p>Because PotatoOS is entirely coded and built with Godot Engine, it's completely compatible with all platforms.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="card">
		<h4>Lightweight and portable</h4>
		<p>No complex virtual machines, no bloated installs (<i>cough cough Microsoft</i>). PotatoOS fits in a single directory and can be moved between systems easily.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="card">
		<h4>Familiar yet unique</h4>
		<p>A Unix-like filesystem and Bash mirror provide a comfortable environment, while features like the STARCH pipeline operator bring fresh ideas to scripting.</p>
