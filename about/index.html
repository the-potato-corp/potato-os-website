	<h3>What is a "parasite OS"?</h3>
</section>
<section class="explanation">
	<p>Instead of running on bare metal, PotatoOS is a single, fullscreen application that runs in a "host" OS like Windows or Linux. This allows it to use the stability while creating its own desktop environment and file system.</p>

	<h2>Why did we choose a parasite OS?</h2>
	<h3>The Problem</h3>
	<h3>The Solution</h3>
	<h3>The Vision</h3>

	<hr>

	<h4>Portability</h4>
	<div class="cell">
		<p>OSes aren't portable. Installation media can be gigabytes in size with bloat (<i>cough cough</i> Windows) and drivers.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="cell">
		<p>A "parasite OS" flips this entirely. PotatoOS takes up under a gigabyte in size, and you don't have to download <i>yey another</i> installer just to get what you want — the whole OS comes in an EXE file.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="cell">
		<p>People can share PotatoOS without having to worry about disk space or whether all the files will be copied over.</p>
	</div>

	<h4>Ease of installation</h4>
	<div class="cell">
		<p>Installing an OS requires a lot of understanding about how computers work on a very low level. You might spend hours fiddling with the BIOS trying to install Linux on your old laptop.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="cell">
		<p>PotatoOS is just a single EXE file. No administrator rights needed, no special registry modifications, and works on every major OS. All dependencies are automatically installed and updating without needing any intervention.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="cell">
		<p>Without the barrier of installation, your average Joe can download PotatoOS and set it up in not hours, but minutes or even seconds with no problems at all. Even students without admin access to laptops can still get PotatoOS.</p>
	</div>

	<h4>Cross-platform</h4>
	<div class="cell">
		<p>Normal OSes have strict system requirements: Windows needs a lot of RAM and MacOS requires Apple hardware. This makes it harder to install them on lower-end or older devices.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="cell">
		<p>But PotatoOS is lighter than them all. If your device runs an OS, it can run PotatoOS. Because it is created with <a href="https://godotengine.org">Godot Engine</a>, it's completely cross-platform and can run on any Linux distro or Windows version.</p>
	</div>
	<div class="cell">
		<p>You can run PotatoOS lightly on any OS, be it Linux, MacOS or Windows, and any hardware from Raspberry Pi to gaming PC.</p>
